Although this covers most of the important aspects of algorithms, the concepts have been detailed in a lucid manner, so as to be palatable to readers at all levels of skill.\r\n\r\nIntroduction To Algorithms has a number of chapters, each of which is self-contained, as it contains an algorithm, followed by a design technique. There is also an area of application or a related topic, so that students can find out the practical implications of the algorithm in question."}]
